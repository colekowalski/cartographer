# cartographer
Cartographer - Responsive web application that allows users to launch Nmap scans from their mobiles/tablets/web browsers!

This project is a fork of [Rainmap
Lite](https://github.com/cldrn/rainmap-lite), which itself is a simplified and
more up-to-date implementation of [Rainmap](https://nmap.org/rainmap/). This
fork was created to implement features such as Celery, which diverge from the
vision of simplicity of the parent project. A great deal of credit is owed, and
if you are after a simple configuration with less required infrastructure, I
recommend checking out Rainmap Lite.

## Features
* Easily launch Nmap scans with a few clicks.
* Responsive interface runs smoothly from your phone/tablet. 
* Reports delivered by email in all formats.
* View reports from your web browser.
* Schedule scans.
* Dozens of scanning profiles to choose from.
* Easy to install/set up.
* Share results with your team.

This project is still in beta version. Any feedback, bug reports and PRs are greatly appreciated!
